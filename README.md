# Person Service

This is a simple grpc service that responds to requests about people.

## Setup

To run the service locally, you will need to have docker installed. The [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) application is the easiest way to get started.

```sh
docker compose watch
```
